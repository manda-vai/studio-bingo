# **App Name**: Bingo Draw

## Core Features:

- Draw Number: Draw a random, non-repeating number between 1 and 99 when the 'Draw' button is clicked.
- Display Drawn Numbers Sequentially: Display the drawn numbers in the order they were drawn.
- Display Drawn Numbers Sorted: Display the drawn numbers in ascending order.
- Check Card: Accept comma-separated numbers in a field and indicate if all numbers have been drawn.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A vibrant blue (#29ABE2) reminiscent of classic bingo cards, but not too dark.
- Background color: A very light blue (#E0F7FA), near-white but with a hint of the primary's hue, providing a clean backdrop.
- Accent color: A contrasting orange (#F4511E), approximately 30 degrees away from the primary on the color wheel, used for highlighting important numbers and the 'Draw' button.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a grotesque-style sans-serif, known for being legible at various sizes.
- The layout should prominently feature the drawn number display, the 'Draw' button, and the card checking input field, arranged in a clear, intuitive manner.
- Use a subtle animation, like a gentle fade-in, to highlight the newly drawn number and make the experience feel responsive and engaging.
